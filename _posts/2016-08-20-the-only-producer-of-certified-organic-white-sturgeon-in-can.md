### NORTHERN DIVINE AQUAFARMS LTD. 

Northern Divine Caviar is crafted by Northern Divine Aquafarms Ltd., Canada's only producer of certified organic farmed Fraser River white sturgeon and your natural choice for high quality, eco-friendly, food products.

Target Marine is located in Canada on the beautiful Sunshine Coast of British Columbia. It's been in business since 1999, and this land based farm is situated along the wooded shores of Porpoise Bay in Sechelt also known as 'the land between two waters', British Columbia. Once focused on producing coho salmon smolts, it is now the only producer of certified organic white sturgeon in Canada.

Over fishing has led to the collapse of fisheries that once supplied most of the world's caviar. Looking to diversify the operations, the company began rearing the first generation of white sturgeon in 2000\. Some of those fish are now ready for harvest, as the company supplies the growing market with a healthy, eco-friendly product that is helping ease the mounting pressure off wild stocks of sturgeon.

The products are Certified Organic, recommended by Ocean Wise, and recognized BEST CHOICE by SeaChoice and SeafoodWatch

As of December 2012 Target Marine was certified organic by Global Trust and the Canadian Organic Aquaculture Standards. It's farmed sturgeon has been labeled as sustainable seafood by Ocean Wise and recommended by Sea Choice and the Monterey Bay Aquarium - Seafood Watch program.
