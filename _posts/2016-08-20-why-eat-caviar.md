WHY EAT CAVIAR?

Caviar is a source of vitamins and minerals, including [omega 3][0], which helps to promote a healthy nervous, circulatory and immune system. One serving of caviar has an adult's daily requirement of **[Vitamin B12][1]**. Other nutrients included are vitamins **A**, **E**, **B6**, **Iron**, **Magnesium** and **Selenium**.

Why Eat Sturgeon? **- [Health Canada][2]**

* Organically Grown
* Contains NO Pesticides, added Hormones or Antibiotics
* Dense, mild-flavoured white flesh, heart healthy fat golden in colour
* Good Source of Protein
* Contains Omega 3's, Vitamin A, B12, E, Calcium, Selenium and Iron which helps to promote strong bones, teeth and a healthy immune system

Sturgeon and other fish contain some of the long chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Recent evidence has suggested that fish consumption and the associated intake of EPA and DHA from fish can help maintain **healthy heart** function. Consumption of fish has also been associated with reduced risk of sudden cardiac death in healthy people and there is evidence that regular consumption of fish by pregnant women and women who may become pregnant plays a role in normal fetal brain and eye development.
